    <h2>About Louis</h2>

    <p>Hannuri Louis Kwon was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1984. Both parents studied physics in college and worked as programmers coding mainframes in COBOL. Louis received a lot of influence from his parents as computer was always part of his life from childhood. </p>

    <p>Because of his father's work, the family relocated to Tokyo, Japan in 1986, and then to Ramsey, NJ in 1995. When he relocated to the USA, he officially adopted his American name Louis as his middle name when he relocated. Louis attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA where he studied Chemical Engineering and graduated in 2007. </p>

    <p>After college, he was commissioned as an US Army Engineer Officer and was stationed in Fort Stewart with the 92ND ENG Battalion. He deployed with the unit to Afghanistan for a year in Paktika Province. He was honorably discharged from the Army in 2011 after finishing his tour in Afghanistan and serving four years.</p>

    <p>Louis headed back to his hometown in NJ for a year, after which he decided to relocate to the DC area in 2013 where he has stayed since then. He enjoys reading and volunteering for causes that he is passionate about. In 2016 he volunteered for the Presidential Campaign to fulfill his bucket list. </p>
